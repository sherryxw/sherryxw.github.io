I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Connecticut. My advisor is [Prof. Jinbo Bi](http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jinbo/). I was supervised by [Prof. Fei Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/feiwang03/) and had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna](http://halcyon.usc.edu/~pk/prasannawebsite/). Before I came here, I got my M.S. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). I have spent some time interning in University of Southern California (2014) and Chinese Academic of Science (2015).

My primary research interests are in deep learning, machine learning and pattern recognition using large-scale datasets, with an emphasis on healthcare informatics, online social networks and bioinformatics. 

Experience
------

### Research Assistant | University of Connecticut  
* Designed deep learning, machine learning methods to improve diseases detection, drug discovery & precision medicine. 
* Created various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) models on domain mappings, missing imputation, etc.
* Developed multi-view and multi-task algorithms that automatically detect disorder problems using daily living datasets.
* Explored contextual embedding of medical concepts from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with Word2vec.
* Constructed the deep neural networks on graphs for node embedding and graph embedding.

### Co-Investigator | Yale Center for Molecular Discovery, Yale University  
* Designed prominent machine learning methods, especially deep learning, for the early stage of drug design.
* Extended Recurrent Neural Networks and Autoencoder models for SMILES strings - text sequences, to learn sensible chemical rules and generate synthesizable molecules encoded as text sequences.
* Designed the molecular graph convolutional networks for learning molecular representations from undirected graphs.

### Student Researcher | University of Southern California  
* Developed effective knowledge discovery and data mining techniques for emerging unstructured data. 
* Implemented script codes to extract the patterns, relevant terms and its associated parameters for Chevron Corporation.

### Visiting Researcher | Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences  
* Built a high-performance computing platform on GPUs to accelerate deep learning research.
* Constructed deep learning models to extract image features via open source deep learning framework Caffe.

### Research Assistant | Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications  
* Analyzed the limitations of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Information Centric Networking (ICN), etc. 
* Collaborated cross team to design and simulate effective congestion control and scheduling algorithms.
